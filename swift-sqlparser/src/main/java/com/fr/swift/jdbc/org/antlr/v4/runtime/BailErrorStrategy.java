/**
 * This implementation of {@link ANTLRErrorStrategy} responds to syntax errors
 * by immediately canceling the parse operation with a
 * {@link ParseCancellationException}. The implementation ensures that the
 * {@link ParserRuleContext#exception} field is set for all parse tree nodes
 * that were not completed prior to encountering the error.
 *
 * <p>
 * This error strategy is useful in the following scenarios.</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>Two-stage parsing:</strong> This error strategy allows the first
 * stage of two-stage parsing to immediately terminate if an error is
 * encountered, and immediately fall back to the second stage. In addition to
 * avoiding wasted work by attempting to recover from errors here, the empty
 * implementation of {@link BailErrorStrategy#sync} improves the performance of
 * the first stage.</li>
 * <li><strong>Silent validation:</strong> When syntax errors are not being
 * reported or logged, and the parse result is simply ignored if errors occur,
 * the {@link BailErrorStrategy} avoids wasting work on recovering from errors
 * when the result will be ignored either way.</li>
 * </ul>

 * {@code myparser.setErrorHandler(new BailErrorStrategy());}</p>
