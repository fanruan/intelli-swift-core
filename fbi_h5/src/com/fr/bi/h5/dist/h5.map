* Animations are an important part of modern UX, and the `Animated`\n * library is designed to make them fluid, powerful, and easy to build and\n * maintain.\n *\n * The simplest workflow is to create an `Animated.Value`, hook it up to one or\n * more style attributes of an animated component, and then drive updates either\n * via animations, such as `Animated.timing`, or by hooking into gestures like\n * panning or scrolling via `Animated.event`.  `Animated.Value` can also bind to\n * props other than style, and can be interpolated as well.  Here is a basic\n * example of a container view that will fade in when it's mounted:\n *\n *```javascript\n *  class FadeInView extends React.Component {\n *    constructor(props) {\n *      super(props);\n *      this.state = {\n *        fadeAnim: new Animated.Value(0), // init opacity 0\n *      };\n *    }\n *    componentDidMount() {\n *      Animated.timing(          // Uses easing functions\n *        this.state.fadeAnim,    // The value to drive\n *        {toValue: 1},           // Configuration\n *      ).start();                // Don't forget start!\n *    }\n *    render() {\n *      return (\n *        <Animated.View          // Special animatable View\n *          style={{opacity: this.state.fadeAnim}}> // Binds\n *          {this.props.children}\n *        </Animated.View>\n *      );\n *    }\n *  }\n *```\n *\n * Note that only animatable components can be animated.  `View`, `Text`, and\n * `Image` are already provided, and you can create custom ones with\n * `createAnimatedComponent`.  These special components do the magic of binding\n * the animated values to the properties, and do targeted native updates to\n * avoid the cost of the react render and reconciliation process on every frame.\n * They also handle cleanup on unmount so they are safe by default.\n *\n * Animations are heavily configurable.  Custom and pre-defined easing\n * functions, delays, durations, decay factors, spring constants, and more can\n * all be tweaked depending on the type of animation.\n *\n * A single `Animated.Value` can drive any number of properties, and each\n * property can be run through an interpolation first.  An interpolation maps\n * input ranges to output ranges, typically using a linear interpolation but\n * also supports easing functions.  By default, it will extrapolate the curve\n * beyond the ranges given, but you can also have it clamp the output value.\n *\n * For example, you may want to think about your `Animated.Value` as going from\n * 0 to 1, but animate the position from 150px to 0px and the opacity from 0 to\n * 1. This can easily be done by modifying `style` in the example above like so:\n *\n *```javascript\n *  style={{\n *    opacity: this.state.fadeAnim, // Binds directly\n *    transform: [{\n *      translateY: this.state.fadeAnim.interpolate({\n *        inputRange: [0, 1],\n *        outputRange: [150, 0]  // 0 : 150, 0.5 : 75, 1 : 0\n *      }),\n *    }],\n *  }}>\n *```\n *\n * Animations can also be combined in complex ways using composition functions\n * such as `sequence` and `parallel`, and can also be chained together simply\n * by setting the `toValue` of one animation to be another `Animated.Value`.\n *\n * `Animated.ValueXY` is handy for 2D animations, like panning, and there are\n * other helpful additions like `setOffset` and `getLayout` to aid with typical\n * interaction patterns, like drag-and-drop.\n *\n * You can see more example usage in `AnimationExample.js`, the Gratuitous\n * Animation App, and [Animations documentation guide](docs/animations.html).\n *\n * Note that `Animated` is designed to be fully serializable so that animations\n * can be run in a high performance way, independent of the normal JavaScript\n * event loop. This does influence the API, so keep that in mind when it seems a\n * little trickier to do something compared to a fully synchronous system.\n * Checkout `Animated.Value.addListener` as a way to work around some of these\n * limitations, but use it sparingly since it might have performance\n * implications in the future.\n */\nmodule.exports={\n/**\n   * Standard value class for driving animations.

It analyzes\r\n * the geometry of elements, and observes when another responder (scroll view\r\n * etc) has stolen the touch lock. It notifies your component when it should\r\n * give feedback to the user. (bouncing/highlighting/unhighlighting).\r\n *\r\n * - When a touch was activated (typically you highlight)\r\n * - When a touch was deactivated (typically you unhighlight)\r\n * - When a touch was \"pressed\" - a touch ended while still within the geometry\r\n *   of the element, and no other element (like scroller) has \"stolen\" touch\r\n *   lock (\"responder\") (Typically you bounce the element).\r\n *\r\n * A good tap interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should be a\r\n * slight delay before showing a highlight when starting a touch. If a\r\n * subsequent touch move exceeds the boundary of the elemement, it should\r\n * unhighlight, but if that same touch is brought back within the boundary, it\r\n * should rehighlight again. A touch can move in and out of that boundary\r\n * several times, each time toggling highlighting, but a \"press\" is only\r\n * triggered if that touch ends while within the element's boundary and no\r\n * scroller (or anything else) has stolen the lock on touches.\r\n *\r\n * To create a new type of component that handles interaction using the\r\n * `Touchable` mixin, do the following:\r\n *\r\n * - Initialize the `Touchable` state.\r\n *\r\n *   getInitialState: function() {\r\n *     return merge(this.touchableGetInitialState(), yourComponentState);\r\n *   }\r\n *\r\n * - Choose the rendered component who's touches should start the interactive\r\n *   sequence. On that rendered node, forward all `Touchable` responder\r\n *   handlers. You can choose any rendered node you like. Choose a node who's\r\n *   hit target you'd like to instigate the interaction sequence:\r\n *\r\n *   // In render function:\r\n *   return (\r\n *     <div\r\n *       onStartShouldSetResponder={this.touchableHandleStartShouldSetResponder}\r\n *       onResponderTerminationRequest={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminationRequest}\r\n *       onResponderGrant={this.touchableHandleResponderGrant}\r\n *       onResponderMove={this.touchableHandleResponderMove}\r\n *       onResponderRelease={this.touchableHandleResponderRelease}\r\n *       onResponderTerminate={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminate}>\r\n *       <div>\r\n *         Even though the hit detection/interactions are triggered by the\r\n *         wrapping (typically larger) node, we usually end up implementing\r\n *         custom logic that highlights this inner one.\r\n *       </div>\r\n *     </div>\r\n *   );\r\n *\r\n * - You may set up your own handlers for each of these events, so long as you\r\n *   also invoke the `touchable*` handlers inside of your custom handler.\r\n *\r\n * - Implement the handlers on your component class in order to provide\r\n *   feedback to the user. See documentation for each of these class methods\r\n *   that you should implement.\r\n *\r\n *   touchableHandlePress: function() {\r\n *      this.performBounceAnimation();  // or whatever you want to do.\r\n *   },\r\n *   touchableHandleActivePressIn: function() {\r\n *     this.beginHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey activation\r\n *   },\r\n *   touchableHandleActivePressOut: function() {\r\n *     this.endHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey deactivation\r\n *   },\r\n *\r\n * - There are more advanced methods you can implement (see documentation below):\r\n

order:\n *\n * `[R, S, C]`\n *\n * To help illustrate the example, assume `S` is `SimpleEventPlugin` (for\n * `onClick` etc) and `R` is `ResponderEventPlugin`.\n *\n * \"Deferred-Dispatched Events\":\n *\n * - The current event plugin system will traverse the list of injected plugins,\n *   in order, and extract events by collecting the plugin's return value of\n *   `extractEvents()`.\n * - These events that are returned from `extractEvents` are \"deferred\n *   dispatched events\".\n * - When returned from `extractEvents`, deferred-dispatched events contain an\n *   \"accumulation\" of deferred dispatches.\n * - These deferred dispatches are accumulated/collected before they are\n *   returned, but processed at a later time by the `EventPluginHub` (hence the\n *   name deferred).\n *\n * In the process of returning their deferred-dispatched events, event plugins\n * themselves can dispatch events on-demand without returning them from\n * `extractEvents`. Plugins might want to do this, so that they can use event\n * dispatching as a tool that helps them decide which events should be extracted\n * in the first place.\n *\n * \"On-Demand-Dispatched Events\":\n *\n * - On-demand-dispatched events are not returned from `extractEvents`.\n * - On-demand-dispatched events are dispatched during the process of returning\n *   the deferred-dispatched events.\n * - They should not have side effects.\n * - They should be avoided, and/or eventually be replaced with another\n *   abstraction that allows event plugins to perform multiple \"rounds\" of event\n *   extraction.\n *\n * Therefore, the sequence of event dispatches becomes:\n *\n * - `R`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `R` on-demand)\n * - `S`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `S` on-demand)\n * - `C`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `C` on-demand)\n * - `R`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n * - `S`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n * - `C`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n *\n * In the case of `ResponderEventPlugin`: If the `startShouldSetResponder`\n * on-demand dispatch returns `true` (and some other details are satisfied) the\n * `onResponderGrant` deferred dispatched event is returned from\n * `extractEvents`. The sequence of dispatch executions in this case\n * will appear as follows:\n *\n * - `startShouldSetResponder` (`ResponderEventPlugin` dispatches on-demand)\n * - `touchStartCapture`       (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n * - `touchStart`              (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n * - `responderGrant/Reject`   (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n */\n\nfunction setResponderAndExtractTransfer(topLevelType, targetInst, nativeEvent, nativeEventTarget) {\n  var shouldSetEventType = isStartish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.startShouldSetResponder : isMoveish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.moveShouldSetResponder : topLevelType === EventConstants.topLevelTypes.topSelectionChange ? eventTypes.selectionChangeShouldSetResponder : eventTypes.scrollShouldSetResponder;\n\n  // TODO: stop one short of the current responder.\n  var bubbleShouldSetFrom = !responderInst ? targetInst : EventPluginUtils.getLowestCommonAncestor(responderInst, targetInst);\n\n  // When capturing/bubbling the \"shouldSet\" event, we want to skip the target\n  // (deepest ID) if it happens to be the current responder.

It is\r\n * complicated, thus this doc is long and (hopefully) detailed enough to answer\r\n * your questions.\r\n *\r\n * If you need to react to the mouse wheel in a predictable way, this code is\r\n * like your bestest friend. * hugs *\r\n *\r\n * As of today, there are 4 DOM event types you can listen to:\r\n *\r\n *   'wheel'                -- Chrome(31+), FF(17+), IE(9+)\r\n *   'mousewheel'           -- Chrome, IE(6+), Opera, Safari\r\n *   'MozMousePixelScroll'  -- FF(3.5 only!) (2010-2013) -- don't bother!\r\n *   'DOMMouseScroll'       -- FF(0.9.7+) since 2003\r\n *\r\n * So what to do?  The is the best:\r\n *\r\n *   normalizeWheel.getEventType();\r\n *\r\n * In your event callback, use this code to get sane interpretation of the\r\n * deltas.  This code will return an object with properties:\r\n *\r\n *   spinX   -- normalized spin speed (use for zoom) - x plane\r\n *   spinY   -- \" - y plane\r\n *   pixelX  -- normalized distance (to pixels) - x plane\r\n *   pixelY  -- \" - y plane\r\n *\r\n * Wheel values are provided by the browser assuming you are using the wheel to\r\n * scroll a web page by a number of lines or pixels (or pages).  Values can vary\r\n * significantly on different platforms and browsers, forgetting that you can\r\n * scroll at different speeds.  Some devices (like trackpads) emit more events\r\n * at smaller increments with fine granularity, and some emit massive jumps with\r\n * linear speed or acceleration.\r\n *\r\n * This code does its best to normalize the deltas for you:\r\n *\r\n *   - spin is trying to normalize how far the wheel was spun (or trackpad\r\n *     dragged).  This is super useful for zoom support where you want to\r\n *     throw away the chunky scroll steps on the PC and make those equal to\r\n *     the slow and smooth tiny steps on the Mac. Key data: This code tries to\r\n *     resolve a single slow step on a wheel to 1.\r\n *\r\n *   - pixel is normalizing the desired scroll delta in pixel units.  You'll\r\n *     get the crazy differences between browsers, but at least it'll be in\r\n *     pixels!\r\n *\r\n *   - positive value indicates scrolling DOWN/RIGHT, negative UP/LEFT.  This\r\n *     should translate to positive value zooming IN, negative zooming OUT.\r\n *     This matches the newer 'wheel' event.\r\n *\r\n * Why are there spinX, spinY (or pixels)?\r\n *\r\n *   - spinX is a 2-finger side drag on the trackpad, and a shift + wheel turn\r\n *     with a mouse.  It results in side-scrolling in the browser by default.\r\n *\r\n *   - spinY is what you expect -- it's the classic axis of a mouse wheel.\r\n *\r\n *   - I dropped spinZ/pixelZ.  It is supported by the DOM 3 'wheel' event and\r\n *     probably is by browsers in conjunction with fancy 3D controllers .. but\r\n *     you know.\r\n *\r\n * Implementation info:\r\n *\r\n * Examples of 'wheel' event if you scroll slowly (down) by one step with an\r\n * average mouse:\r\n *\r\n *   OS X + Chrome  (mouse)     -    4   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\r\n *   OS X + Safari  (mouse)     -  N/A   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  -12)\r\n *   OS X + Firefox (mouse)     -    0.1 line  delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\r\n *   Win8 + Chrome  (mouse)     -  100   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\r\n *   Win8 + Firefox (mouse)     -    3   line  delta  (wheelDelta -120)\r\n *\r\n * On the trackpad:\r\n *\r\n *   OS X + Chrome  (trackpad)  -    2   pixel delta  (wheelDelta   -6)\r\n *   OS X + Firefox (trackpad)  -    1   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\r\n *\r\n * On other/older browsers.. it's more complicated as there can be multiple and\r\n * also missing delta values.\r\n *\r\n * The 'wheel' event is more standard:\r\n *\r\n * http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-wheelevents\r\n *\r\n * The basics is that it includes a unit, deltaMode (pixels, lines, pages), and\r\n * deltaX, deltaY and deltaZ.  Some browsers provide other values to maintain\r\n * backward compatibility with older events.  Those other values help us\r\n * better normalize spin speed.  Example of what the browsers provide:\r\n *\r\n *                          | event.wheelDelta | event.detail\r\n *        ------------------+------------------+--------------\r\n *          Safari v5/OS X  |       -120       |       0\r\n *          Safari v5/Win7  |       -120       |       0\r\n *         Chrome v17/OS X  |       -120       |       0\r\n *         Chrome v17/Win7  |       -120       |       0\r\n *                IE9/Win7  |       -120       |   undefined\r\n *         Firefox v4/OS X  |     undefined    |       1\r\n *         Firefox v4/Win7  |     undefined    |       3\r\n *\r\n */\r\nfunction normalizeWheel(/*object*/event) /*object*/ {\r\n    var sX = 0,\r\n        sY = 0,\r\n    // spinX, spinY\r\n        pX = 0,\r\n        pY = 0; // pixelX, pixelY\r\n\r\n    // Legacy\r\n    if ('detail' in event) {\r\n        sY = event.detail;\r\n    }\r\n    if ('wheelDelta' in event) {\r\n        sY = -event.wheelDelta / 120;\r\n    }\r\n    if ('wheelDeltaY' in event) {\r\n        sY = -event.wheelDeltaY / 120;\r\n    }\r\n    if ('wheelDeltaX' in event) {\r\n        sX = -event.wheelDeltaX / 120;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // side scrolling on FF with DOMMouseScroll\r\n    if ('axis' in event && event.axis === event.HORIZONTAL_AXIS) {\r\n        sX = sY;\r\n        sY = 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    pX = sX * PIXEL_STEP;\r\n    pY = sY * PIXEL_STEP;\r\n\r\n    if ('deltaY' in event) {\r\n        pY = event.deltaY;\r\n    }\r\n    if ('deltaX' in event) {\r\n        pX = event.deltaX;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if ((pX || pY) && event.deltaMode) {\r\n        if (event.deltaMode === 1) {\r\n            // delta in LINE units\r\n            pX *= LINE_HEIGHT;\r\n            pY *= LINE_HEIGHT;\r\n        } else {\r\n            // delta in PAGE units\r\n            pX *= PAGE_HEIGHT;\r\n            pY *= PAGE_HEIGHT;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Fall-back if spin cannot be determined\r\n    if (pX && !sX) {\r\n        sX = pX < 1 ? -1 : 1;\r\n    }\r\n    if (pY && !sY) {\r\n        sY = pY < 1 ? -1 : 1;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return {\r\n        spinX: sX,\r\n        spinY: sY,\r\n        pixelX: pX,\r\n        pixelY: pY\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * The best combination if you prefer spinX + spinY normalization.

The input blob can be as simple as an\r\n * array of strings, or an object with rows nested inside section objects.\r\n *\r\n * To update the data in the datasource, use `cloneWithRows` (or\r\n * `cloneWithRowsAndSections` if you care about sections).  The data in the\r\n * data source is immutable, so you can't modify it directly.  The clone methods\r\n * suck in the new data and compute a diff for each row so ListView knows\r\n * whether to re-render it or not.\r\n *\r\n * In this example, a component receives data in chunks, handled by\r\n * `_onDataArrived`, which concats the new data onto the old data and updates the\r\n * data source.  We use `concat` to create a new array - mutating `this._data`,\r\n * e.g. with `this._data.push(newRowData)`, would be an error. `_rowHasChanged`\r\n * understands the shape of the row data and knows how to efficiently compare\r\n * it.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * getInitialState: function() {\r\n *   var ds = new ListViewDataSource({rowHasChanged: this._rowHasChanged});\r\n *   return {ds};\r\n * },\r\n * _onDataArrived(newData) {\r\n *   this._data = this._data.concat(newData);\r\n *   this.setState({\r\n *     ds: this.state.ds.cloneWithRows(this._data)\r\n *   });\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n */\r\n\r\nclass ListViewDataSource {\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * You can provide custom extraction and `hasChanged` functions for section\r\n   * headers and rows.

The only way\r\n * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\r\n * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\r\n *\r\n * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\r\n * necessary\r\n *\r\n * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\r\n * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\r\n * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\r\n * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\r\n *\r\n * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\r\n * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\r\n * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\r\n * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\r\n * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\r\n * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\r\n * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\r\n * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\r\n * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\r\n * events.\r\n *\r\n * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\r\n *\r\n * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\r\n *\r\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\r\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\r\n *\r\n * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\r\n * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\r\n * for the dismissal of the keyboard. There are other reasons why the\r\n * keyboard could be dismissed.\r\n *\r\n *   this.props.onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed\r\n *\r\n * Standard Keyboard Hide Sequence:\r\n *\r\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillHide\r\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidHide\r\n */\r\n\r\nconst IS_ANIMATING_TOUCH_START_THRESHOLD_MS = 16;\r\n\r\nlet ScrollResponderMixin = {\r\n  // mixins: [Subscribable.Mixin],\r\n  // statics: RCTScrollViewConsts,\r\n  scrollResponderMixinGetInitialState: function ():{\r\n    isTouching: boolean,\r\n    lastMomentumScrollBeginTime: number,\r\n    lastMomentumScrollEndTime: number,\r\n    observedScrollSinceBecomingResponder: boolean,\r\n    becameResponderWhileAnimating: boolean\r\n    } {\r\n    return {\r\n      isTouching: false,\r\n      lastMomentumScrollBeginTime: 0,\r\n      lastMomentumScrollEndTime: 0,\r\n\r\n      // Reset to false every time becomes responder.

For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n   *\n   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n   *     }\n   *\n   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   */\n  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n        return true;\n      }\n      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  function deepEqual(a, b) {\n    if (a === b) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    if (\n      !isIterable(b) ||\n      a.size !== undefined && b.size !== undefined && a.size !== b.size ||\n      a.__hash !== undefined && b.__hash !== undefined && a.__hash !== b.__hash ||\n      isKeyed(a) !== isKeyed(b) ||\n      isIndexed(a) !== isIndexed(b) ||\n      isOrdered(a) !== isOrdered(b)\n    ) {\n      return false;\n    }\n\n    if (a.size === 0 && b.size === 0) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    var notAssociative = !isAssociative(a);\n\n    if (isOrdered(a)) {\n      var entries = a.entries();\n      return b.every(function(v, k)  {\n        var entry = entries.next().value;\n        return entry && is(entry[1], v) && (notAssociative || is(entry[0], k));\n      }) && entries.next().done;\n    }\n\n    var flipped = false;\n\n    if (a.size === undefined) {\n      if (b.size === undefined) {\n        if (typeof a.cacheResult === 'function') {\n          a.cacheResult();\n        }\n      } else {\n        flipped = true;\n        var _ = a;\n        a = b;\n        b = _;\n      }\n    }\n\n    var allEqual = true;\n    var bSize = b.__iterate(function(v, k)  {\n      if (notAssociative ? !a.has(v) :\n          flipped ? !is(v, a.get(k, NOT_SET)) : !is(a.get(k, NOT_SET), v)) {\n        allEqual = false;\n        return false;\n      }\n    });\n\n    return allEqual && a.size === bSize;\n  }\n\n  createClass(Repeat, IndexedSeq);\n\n    function Repeat(value, times) {\n      if (!(this instanceof Repeat)) {\n        return new Repeat(value, times);\n      }\n      this._value = value;\n      this.size = times === undefined ?

It's now been adopted by several other Android\n// applications. This JavaScript port was written to provide a quick\n// way to demonstrate Rebound animations on the web for a\n// [conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5kNm-DgyjY). Since then\n// the JavaScript version has been used to build some really nice interfaces.\n// Check out [brandonwalkin.com](http://brandonwalkin.com) for an\n// example.\n//\n// Overview\n// --------\n// The Library provides a SpringSystem for maintaining a set of Spring\n// objects and iterating those Springs through a physics solver loop\n// until equilibrium is achieved. The Spring class is the basic\n// animation driver provided by Rebound. By attaching a listener to\n// a Spring, you can observe its motion. The observer function is\n// notified of position changes on the spring as it solves for\n// equilibrium. These position updates can be mapped to an animation\n// range to drive animated property updates on your user interface\n// elements (translation, rotation, scale, etc).\n//\n// Example\n// -------\n// Here's a simple example. Pressing and releasing on the logo below\n// will cause it to scale up and down with a springy animation.\n//\n// <div style=\"text-align:center; margin-bottom:50px; margin-top:50px\">\n//   <img\n//     src=\"http://facebook.github.io/rebound/images/rebound.png\"\n//     id=\"logo\"\n//   />\n// </div>\n// <script src=\"../rebound.min.js\"></script>\n// <script>\n//\n// function scale(el, val) {\n//   el.style.mozTransform =\n//   el.style.msTransform =\n//   el.style.webkitTransform =\n//   el.style.transform = 'scale3d(' + val + ', ' + val + ', 1)';\n// }\n// var el = document.getElementById('logo');\n//\n// var springSystem = new rebound.SpringSystem();\n// var spring = springSystem.createSpring(50, 3);\n// spring.addListener({\n//   onSpringUpdate: function(spring) {\n//     var val = spring.getCurrentValue();\n//     val = rebound.MathUtil.mapValueInRange(val, 0, 1, 1, 0.5);\n//     scale(el, val);\n//   }\n// });\n//\n// el.addEventListener('mousedown', function() {\n//   spring.setEndValue(1);\n// });\n//\n// el.addEventListener('mouseout', function() {\n//   spring.setEndValue(0);\n// });\n//\n// el.addEventListener('mouseup', function() {\n//   spring.setEndValue(0);\n// });\n//\n// </script>\n//\n// Here's how it works.\n//\n// ```\n// // Get a reference to the logo element.\n// var el = document.getElementById('logo');\n//\n// // create a SpringSystem and a Spring with a bouncy config.\n// var springSystem = new rebound.SpringSystem();\n// var spring = springSystem.createSpring(50, 3);\n//\n// // Add a listener to the spring.
